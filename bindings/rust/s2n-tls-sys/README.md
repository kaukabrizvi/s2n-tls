This crates provides low level rust bindings for [s2n-tls](https://github.com/aws/s2n-tls) which are autogenerated with [bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen)

This crate is not intended for direct consumption by end consumers. Interested developers should instead look at the [s2n-tls](https://crates.io/crates/s2n-tls) or [s2n-tls-tokio](https://crates.io/crates/s2n-tls-tokio) crates. These  provide higher-level, more ergonomic bindings than the `s2n-tls-sys` crate.

The build process for the s2n-tls library can be customized using sa few environment variables. These variables allow you to specify external library locations or configure the build process. Below is an explanation of the key environment variables used:

`S2N_TLS_DIR`: This variable specifies the base directory for the s2n-tls library. If this variable is set, it can be used to derive the locations for the library and include directories.

`S2N_TLS_LIB_DIR`: This variable specifies the directory containing the s2n-tls library files (e.g., libs2n.a or libs2n.so). If not set explicitly, it defaults to the lib subdirectory within the S2N_TLS_DIR.

`S2N_TLS_INCLUDE_DIR`: This variable specifies the directory containing the header files for the s2n-tls library. If not set explicitly, it defaults to the include subdirectory within the S2N_TLS_DIR.

Usage Example
Here is how you can set these variables in your build environment:

``
export S2N_TLS_DIR=/path/to/s2n-tls
export S2N_TLS_LIB_DIR=/path/to/s2n-tls/lib
export S2N_TLS_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/s2n-tls/include
``
